# Retrospective

## 9/10/2019
- [x] Presentation

### Good
- Every sprint is improving the agile framework, for instance now we have better definitions of contracts to avoid governance blockers.
- The xpo team have always had a good reception to our improvements proposals. Sometimes due to difficult communication (language, culture), it leads to bad implementations. Anyway we are improve communications on daily basis.
- The DEV and QA team have great communication for instace bugs are always welcomed.

### Bad
- [ ] Tasks or subtasks that never close beacuse other team is blocking them. @filip
- [ ] "Ready for Build" and the unassignment process. @luisina
- [ ] Doubtful points of the project in general. How can Guillermina help? @braulio
- [ ] Connection latency. @annia
- [ ] Business rules mussing in User Stories. @ximena
- [ ] Frontend and backend sync order in the User Stories. @braulio @juan @filip
- [ ] Follow agile framework. Lack of Ryan's time. The User Stories should be well defined in the grooming/pre-planning meeting. If not, there is little time to estimate them. Possibility to say that a User Stories is not mature in the grooming/pre-plannig for next Sprint.
- [ ] Stephen technical knowledge. If he is missing it may be a blocker to the whole Sprint. He must be present in grooming/pre-planning. Evert User Story should be validated by him, to determine its impact on the technical side.
- [ ] Board structure changes. @annia
- [ ] Comments usage in issues in general. @luisina
- [ ] Using bug tag when a story has been tested and has an issue. @luisina
